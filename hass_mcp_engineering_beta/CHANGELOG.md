# Changelog

## 2.0.0-beta.3

- Add fail-closed beta deployment and metadata validation for Windows development.
- Add a repeatable beta release checklist, optional health check, and cache-delay
  troubleshooting guidance.
- Keep the production v1.1.2 add-on and runtime unchanged.

## 2.0.0-beta.2

- Explicitly register `get_server_health` with the served FastMCP registry and
  verify its `tools/list`/`tools/call` exposure.

  logs, and audit records; entity 404s now use `entity_not_found`.
- Add typed success and failure response contracts and a stable error taxonomy.
- Add request correlation, structured logging, bounded audit records, timing,
  and safe runtime metrics.
- Add beta-native `get_server_health` and migrate `server_info`,
  `list_capabilities`, and `get_error_log` to structured responses.

## 2.0.0-beta.1

- Add an isolated, parallel-installable v2 beta add-on.
- Introduce modular application, gateway, client, model, audit, capability, and
  version boundaries.
- Preserve the v1.1.2 25-tool catalog and public argument schemas.
