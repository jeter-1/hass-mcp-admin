# Beta provider security boundaries

## Capability truth

Provider labels describe the transport actually used. A direct Home Assistant REST or
WebSocket call is always labeled `direct_ha_api`; it is never relabeled as
`standard_ha_mcp`. Approximate upstream tool matching is prohibited.

Beta 9 permits four narrowly scoped administrative reads:

| Tool | Direct policy | Allowed operation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `get_entity` | `exact_entity_state_read` | `GET /states/{entity_id}` |
| `list_areas` | `complete_area_registry_read` | `config/area_registry/list` WebSocket command |
| `search_services` | `bounded_service_catalog_search` | Bounded `GET /services` search |
| `list_services` | `bounded_service_schema_read` | Bounded `GET /services` schema enumeration |

These policies do not authorize calls to services, automation writes, deletion,
reloads, restarts, physical actions, or destructive operations. Governed configuration
changes retain their existing plan, approval, verification, rollback, correlation, and
audit requirements.

## Standard Home Assistant MCP

Home Assistant documents a stateless Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint at `/api/mcp`. From
an add-on it is available through the fixed Supervisor Core API proxy at
`http://supervisor/core/api/mcp`, authenticated by the add-on's Supervisor bearer token.
The selected Assist API does not expose exact entity-ID lookup, complete area-registry
enumeration, or service-catalog discovery. `GetLiveContext` is therefore not used as a
substitute. Beta 9 retains the gateway abstraction but does not configure or call the
upstream endpoint.

Any future live delegation requires an exact or explicitly reviewed loss-tolerant
contract, fixed destination validation, bounded timeouts, redacted authentication, and
schema-verified upstream discovery.

## Secret handling

Access secrets, Supervisor tokens, authorization headers, authenticated MCP paths,
session identifiers, and raw upstream error bodies are excluded from tool results,
health output, provider metadata, logs, audit records, fixtures, and documentation.
Complete authenticated paths must be redacted before diagnostics are shared.
